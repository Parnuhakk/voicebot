# Deploy to Coolify → robot.arleserver.cfd

## Restaurant release — current default

The current product is restaurant reception in ET/EN/RU. Use
`VOICEBOT_BUSINESS_TYPE=restaurant`, `RESTAURANT_DEMO_WRITES=1` for explicitly
fictional reservations, `RESTAURANT_STATE_DB=/data/restaurant-booking.db` and
`CALLS_DB=/data/calls.db`. Mount the existing persistent `/data` volume in both
web and native worker containers. EasyAppointments credentials are optional in
restaurant mode. An absent restaurant write flag inherits the prior authorized
`EASY_DEMO_WRITES` setting; an explicit `0` disables table writes.

The root page at `https://robot.arleserver.cfd/` serves restaurant voice and
table controls. It is the only published Voicebot domain. `/hotel` returns 410
without a redirect in restaurant mode. Remove the earlier guest website's
dedicated ingress file as described in the [robot-only domain runbook](deploy/robot-domain/README.md).
See [restaurant configuration, deployment and
rollback](docs/operations/restaurants.md). The older hotel/spa settings below
are rollback and historical deployment context. Voice provider settings and
the separate media worker deployment still apply to the restaurant pipeline.

Dashboard + API in one container. Coolify terminates TLS and proxies to
port 8000. No secrets are baked into the image (see `.dockerignore`).

## 0. Prereqs

- Canonical repository: `Parnuhakk/voicebot`, branch `master`.
  Coolify's repository source must use the organization, not the former personal repo.
- DNS `robot.arleserver.cfd` → your Coolify server IP (A record).
- Coolify server with a configured wildcard or per-domain TLS (Let's Encrypt).

## 1. Create the service

1. Coolify → New Resource → **Dockerfile** (public/private repo, branch).
2. Build context / Dockerfile location: repo root if you push `voicebot/`
   as the repo root; otherwise set base directory to `voicebot/`.
3. Port: **8000**. Health check path: **/health**.
4. Domains → add `https://robot.arleserver.cfd` (TLS on, force HTTPS on).

Do not add the retired Meretuule hostname or install a separate guest-website
router. The robot root serves the restaurant application directly. Its old
`/hotel` and `/hotel/` paths return HTTP 410 without `Location`; there is no
public guest-site redirect or root-to-hotel rewrite.

## 2. Environment (Coolify → Environment Variables)

Minimum (demo runs without providers):
```
PORT=8000
OPERATOR_TOKEN=<long random string>   # required to confirm/cancel holds
```
Later (live voice — mirrors `.env.example` exactly):
```
GROQ_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
LIVEKIT_URL=...  LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...  LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...  # all three required for configured media status
SIP_TRUNK_ADDRESS=...  SIP_AUTH_USERNAME=...  SIP_AUTH_PASSWORD=...  SIP_INBOUND_NUMBER=...
APALEO_CLIENT_ID=...  APALEO_CLIENT_SECRET=...
MEWS_CLIENT_TOKEN=...  MEWS_ACCESS_TOKEN=...  MEWS_CLIENT=...  MEWS_API_BASE_URL=...
CLOUDBEDS_API_KEY=...  ZENOTI_API_KEY=...
EASY_BASE_URL=http://voicebot-easyappointments  EASY_API_KEY=...
EASY_DEMO_WRITES=1  EASY_STATE_DB=/data/easy-booking.db
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=...  AZURE_REGION=...  AZURE_VOICE=et-EE-AnuNeural  AZURE_LANG=et-EE
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=...  LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=...  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=...
CALLS_DB=/data/calls.db
VOICEBOT_PROD=1
```
Never commit these — Coolify env only (mirrors `.env.example`).

The Easy values above enable **only the synthetic, operator-authenticated demo**.
Leave `EASY_DEMO_WRITES=0` for an unverified instance or real guest/property
traffic. The separately deployed booking stack joins the `coolify` network;
PHP/MySQL are not embedded in the voicebot image. Its admin UI binds only to
loopback port 8088. [Booking runbook](deploy/easyappointments/README.md).

Single-process assumption: in-memory search/hold snapshots + demo STORE diverge if
replicas scale past 1 — keep Coolify replicas at exactly 1.

Scale continuous-call **agent workers** separately from this web/API container.
The fictional room demo uses `STAY_STATE_DB=/data/stay-booking.db` on this same
volume. `STAY_DEMO_WRITES` follows `EASY_DEMO_WRITES` when absent; explicit `0`
disables it. The native worker uses the identical room database path. The room
inventory and receipts must survive replacement alongside the Easy journal;
never initialize a different worker volume for this feature. The hotel/spa
renderer is retained only for explicit rollback/local regression checks; it
is not a separate published website. The public restaurant DTOs expose only
disclosed venue/menu information, and all booking writes retain operator
authentication and call-owned confirmation rules.
The Easy write journal persists on `/data` and its file lock coordinates a
shared single-host journal. This does not make search/hold state distributed.

**Required:** configure `/data` explicitly under application **Persistent Storage**.
Dockerfile `VOLUME ["/data"]` alone creates an anonymous volume per replacement
container; it does not provide redeployment durability. If data already exists,
reference its exact existing Docker volume name rather than initializing a new
one. The telephone worker must reference the same volume. Verify both mount names
and journal row counts after deployment; never silently move either process to a
new empty journal. This private pilot preserves the original volume; unused
anonymous volumes were not deleted.

Do not increase web replicas until holds use Redis and logs use
Postgres or a single-writer service. See
[`docs/operations/concurrency-and-capacity.md`](docs/operations/concurrency-and-capacity.md).

## 3. Automatic deployment from GitHub

The existing production application deploys pushes and merges to `master` in
`Parnuhakk/voicebot` through a signed GitHub repository webhook. It uses the
public-repository source; no GitHub App installation or Actions workflow is needed.

- Coolify: keep repository `Parnuhakk/voicebot`, branch `master`, **Auto Deploy**
  enabled, preview deployments disabled, and watch paths empty.
- GitHub → repository **Settings → Webhooks**: active hook **691219586**, event
  **push** only, content type **application/json**, SSL verification enabled.
  Callback: `https://coolify.arleserver.cfd/webhooks/source/github/events/manual`.
- Reuse the application's existing GitHub signing value from Coolify's
  **Webhooks** settings when repairing the hook. Never commit or log that value.
  The receiver verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` against the raw request body.
- GitHub sends pushes for all branches; Coolify matches the repository and
  configured branch. Other branches and unmerged pull requests do not deploy
  production. Deployment is skipped when every nonempty commit message in the
  push contains `[skip ci]` or `[skip cd]`.

To verify a deployment, push a normal change to `master`, then inspect the hook's
**Recent Deliveries** and the application's **Deployments**. Require a push for
`refs/heads/master`, a queued deployment for its commit, and a finished deployment
running that revision. A successful creation ping is not deployment proof;
HTTP 200 alone is also insufficient because rejected signatures return a failed
result with HTTP 200. After deployment, verify health plus the existing `/data`
mount and journal counts (see Persistent Storage requirements above).
The hook deploys the web/API application. On the existing Arle host,
`voicebot-release-sync.timer` then synchronizes the native worker and Twilio
bridge to the same healthy published `master` revision. It checks every minute,
waits while voice rooms are active, preserves the shared journal and existing
bridge credentials, and never restarts the booking or media infrastructure.
See the [telephone release pipeline](deploy/telephony/README.md#automatic-release-synchronization).
Only pushed/merged `master` changes deploy; uncommitted work and other branches
remain outside production. A `[skip cd]` documentation push does not create a
new web release, so synchronization waits for the next ordinary deployment.

## 4. Verify

- `https://robot.arleserver.cfd/health` → `{"ok": true}`
- `https://robot.arleserver.cfd/` → disclosed fictional operator dashboard
  (provider-backed bookings, catalogue, text/microphone demo, technical calls).
- The retired Meretuule hostname does not serve the website, assets or APIs.
- Public robot `/hotel` and `/hotel/` → HTTP 410 with no `Location` header.
- Confirm/cancel without or with a wrong client token → 403. 503 means
  the server itself has no `OPERATOR_TOKEN` configured — check Coolify env.

## 5. Local mirror (same as Coolify builds)

```
cd voicebot
docker build -t voicebot:local .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e OPERATOR_TOKEN=demo-token voicebot:local
```

## Notes

- The [natural conversation profile](docs/operations/natural-conversation.md)
  shares voice pacing and pronunciation across HTTP/native speech. Browser
  replies use high-fidelity 48 kHz / 96 kbit/s MP3; native PCM remains 24 kHz.
- Optional [modern website voice profiles](docs/operations/modern-voices.md)
  use server-only provider credentials and a locked session selector. Azure
  remains the default/fallback. Incremental MP3 playback improves buffering on
  supported browsers; Google REST stays explicitly buffered. An available
  configuration does not prove live audio quality or telephone activation.
- Mutations, demo sessions, `/api/turn`, `/api/calls`, `/api/bookings` and
  `/api/catalogue` require operator authorization; responses/errors are `no-store`.
  The operator token exists only in page memory; logout clears private content,
  audio/microphone and late in-flight replies. No browser-to-provider credentials.
- The container runs as non-root `voicebot` (uid 10001).
- The separate [private telephone deployment](deploy/telephony/README.md) uses
  LiveKit/SIP/Redis and shares the existing booking volume. Public SIP ingress
  cannot be supplied by this HTTP proxy. The first US Twilio carrier path instead
  uses a separately deployed signed HTTPS/WSS bridge on `/api/twilio/`, forwarding
  to private LiveKit. Do not fold its media runtime into this HTTP image. Fresh
  rotated credentials and a real incoming call remain activation gates.
  Postgres/Langfuse remain target components, not deployed claims.
